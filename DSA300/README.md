# DSA-300 Portfolio Entry: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This entry showcases my work from DSA-300, focusing on applying data structures and algorithms to solve practical programming problems. It includes my runtime and memory analysis from Project One and the working code for sorting and printing course lists from Project Two.

## Project Summary and Reflection

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

In Project One, the core problem was analyzing the runtime and memory usage of different data structures (Vector, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree) when used to store and access course information. This involved understanding the trade-offs between different data structures in terms of efficiency. Project Two built upon this by requiring the development of a functional program that could load course data, sort it, and display it according to user requests. The program addressed the need for an efficient tool to assist academic advisors.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

I approached these problems by first designing pseudocode to outline the algorithms and data structures needed for each task. This allowed me to reason through the logic and identify potential performance bottlenecks before writing any code. Data structures are essential because they provide a way to organize and store data efficiently, directly impacting the performance and scalability of a program. Choosing the right data structure is often the key to solving a problem effectively. I then used the big O to estimate the total run time for each function.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

I faced a number of roadblocks as I worked through the program including proper coding, formatting, and data retrieval. I had to work through proper iteration in both BST and Hash Tables. Each roadblock was worked around using the guidance and helpful instructions of experts and mentors who could work me through each of the problems and give me the proper insights to resolve them myself.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

This project significantly expanded my understanding of how data structures influence program design. I now consider data structures earlier in the design process. These experiences have made me think more critically about the scalability of my solutions, and this is essential as I progress and look to improve and expand my work in the future.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I focused on writing modular code with clear function definitions and comments throughout the codebase. I was able to make small improvements such as adding the correct implementation of <limits>. I learned a lot from this and feel that in the future I will be much more adaptable as well as readable and maintainable for code.
