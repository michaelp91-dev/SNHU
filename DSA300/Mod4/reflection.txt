The provided C++ code implements a hash table data structure designed for managing and accessing bid information efficiently. The primary purpose is to store, retrieve, and manipulate bid data based on unique bid identifiers. To solve this, the code employs a hash function to map bid IDs to specific locations (buckets) within the hash table, with chaining used to handle collisions, where multiple bid IDs might hash to the same bucket. This involves creating a linked list at each bucket to hold all bids hashing to that location. Key techniques include dynamic memory allocation, using `new` to create nodes on the heap and `delete` to free them; and vector operations to manage the underlying table and linked lists.

A key challenge encountered was managing collisions effectively and ensuring that the linked lists at each bucket did not grow excessively long, which could diminish search performance. This was approached by using a modulo-based hash function (key % tableSize) and by dynamically resizing the table if needed although in this version the table size is set when the HashTable is instantiated. Another challenge was implementing the removal logic to handle various cases in the chain: deleting the head node, a middle node, or the end node. This was overcome by properly updating the linked list pointers when removing nodes, considering different scenarios. Memory management, ensuring proper use of `new` and `delete`, was also carefully addressed to avoid memory leaks.
