The purpose of this code is to implement a functional Binary Search Tree data structure that can efficiently store, retrieve, and manage bid information. The core functionality includes inserting new bids, removing existing bids, searching for specific bids by their ID, and traversing the tree in various orders (in-order, pre-order, post-order) for display purposes. The code utilizes recursive techniques for tree traversal (inOrder, postOrder, preOrder), insertion (addNode), and removal (removeNode), leveraging the inherent recursive nature of tree structures to simplify complex operations. Additionally, an iterative approach is used for the search operation, which can be more efficient for finding specific elements within the tree. The code employs a structure called Node to represent the tree's nodes and a Bid structure to hold the information being stored in the tree.

Several challenges were encountered during the development process, such as ensuring correct memory management (especially during node deletion) and handling edge cases in recursive functions like those used for deletion. The scope of variables like the deletePostOrder lambda function, and how they needed to be used to properly destruct the tree was difficult. Furthermore, correctly implementing the complex logic of the node removal operation with various child scenarios was also a challenge, especially the two-child removal case. To address these issues, a careful step-by-step approach to designing the recursive logic of the tree was used, making sure base cases and other scenarios were handled correctly. Additionally, using the debugger and test-driven development helped identify and fix logic errors and memory issues. The lambda function was moved to the private section of the class to enable it's use for destroying the tree, and global function calls had to be used to resolve scope issues.
