This C++ code implements a LinkedList class designed to manage a collection of Bid objects, where each Bid contains information about a sale, including a unique ID, title, fund, and amount. The primary purpose of this code is to demonstrate fundamental data structure concepts using a linked list, including inserting elements at both the beginning and end of the list, traversing and printing the list, removing elements by ID, and searching for a specific bid. The code uses dynamic memory allocation with new and delete to manage Node objects, which are the building blocks of the linked list, and implements techniques like pointer manipulation to navigate through the list during insertion, deletion, and search operations. It also incorporates a CSV parser to load bid data from an external file, showcasing how real-world data can be integrated with custom data structures.

The main challenge in implementing the linked list was managing the pointers correctly to prevent memory leaks and logic errors, especially when dealing with edge cases like inserting into or removing from an empty list or at the beginning of a list. Special care was needed to handle the head and tail pointers appropriately during prepend, append, and remove operations. For example, the Remove function had to account for deleting the head node and updating the head pointer or deleting the tail node and updating the tail pointer as well as the case where the list is empty to avoid dangling pointers. These issues were addressed through careful code design and testing, ensuring that pointers are always updated correctly and memory is released when no longer needed. Additionally, the code handles the case where an item is not found during the search operation and gracefully returns an empty Bid object.
