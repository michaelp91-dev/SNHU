Hey y'all,

I'm focusing on the **Development Team** role for this discussion.

**Which of the top three traits identified for your role do you think are the most important?**

According to the "Characteristics of a Great Scrum Team" article, the top three traits for the Development Team are: Self-Organizing, Cross-Functional, and Committed. I believe **Self-Organizing** is the most important.

**How does your selected trait help the Scrum team achieve its goal?**

Self-organization leads to increased efficiency, faster problem-solving, and higher motivation. By empowering the team, Scrum can deliver better products more efficiently.

**Is there another trait that you think is important but is not explicitly defined for your selected role in the top characteristics? Support your choice with real-world examples and discuss the outcome of the product, either good or bad.**

I believe **Focus** deserves more emphasis. A team can be self-organizing, cross-functional, and committed, but without focus, efforts can be scattered. I've seen teams struggle to deliver on time because members were distracted by non-essential tasks or lengthy debates. Conversely, when teams maintained focus, they delivered higher-quality products on time. The ability to prioritize and stay aligned with the Sprint Goal is essential.
