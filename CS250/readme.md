This repository contains the Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable from the CS-250 Final Project. This project involved applying Agile and Scrum practices to the development of a travel booking software.

**Reflections on Essential Questions**

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Interpreting user needs involves actively engaging with users and stakeholders to understand their goals, pain points, and desires. This can be achieved through methods like interviews, user meetings, surveys, and usability testing. User stories are a valuable tool in this process. They provide a simple and understandable way to capture user needs, focusing on the user's perspective and motivation. User stories also aid in prioritizing development efforts, facilitating communication among team members, and defining testable acceptance criteria.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

Developing programs effectively involves a combination of coding skills, communication, and adaptability. Agile methodologies provide a framework for this approach, emphasizing iterative development, continuous feedback, and collaboration. Key Agile processes I intend to incorporate into my future development work include:

* Iterative development with sprints 
* User story creation and prioritization 
* Continuous integration and testing 
* Regular communication and feedback loops with stakeholders 
* Utilizing Agile project management tools for planning, tracking, and collaboration 

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Being a good team member in software development involves more than just technical proficiency. It requires effective communication, collaboration, and a focus on shared goals. Key aspects include:

* Clear and concise communication 
* Active listening and seeking clarification
* Providing and receiving constructive feedback 
* Collaborating to solve problems and achieve shared goals 
* Adapting to change and supporting team members
